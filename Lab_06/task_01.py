# ============================================================
# Task 1 — Functions as values
# ============================================================
# Create a function:
#
#   square(number)
#
# that returns number ** 2.
#
# Then:
# 1. assign the function object to a new variable called operation;
# 2. call square(5);
# 3. call operation(5);
# 4. print whether operation is square.
#
# Expected final comparison:
# True
#
# Important:
# operation = square
# stores the function object.
#
# operation = square()
# would call the function immediately.

def square(number):
    return number ** 2

print(square(5))
operation = square
print(operation(5))
